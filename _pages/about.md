At Empowered Technology, we’re well placed to understand the demands of the complex but highly lucrative international market for leading-edge technology vendors.

We’ve worked with start-ups for more than 20 years, including some that have since been acquired by the likes of 3Com, Hewlett Packard, Juniper Networks and Ivanti.

We know how to position technologies, how to set up distribution channels, and how to avoid the many pitfalls along the way. We believe our ‘bridging the gap’ approach to international expansion offers big benefits to companies looking to grow quickly. But we also recognise how critical it is to have the right local team in place.

Empowered Technology was set up in 2010 by Paul Donovan and Graham Duthie.
