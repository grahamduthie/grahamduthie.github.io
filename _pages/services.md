Overseas expansion is increasingly vital for today’s technology start-ups. But knowing how to do it quickly and effectively can be a huge barrier for them – and getting it wrong can be a costly and sometimes even fatal mistake.

At Empowered Technology, we help IT vendors launch outside their home markets with a minimum of risk. We provide a proven, up-and-running operational team in Europe so that vendors can grow their business quickly and at a fraction of the cost of doing it themselves. The Empowered Technology route lets them ‘test’ the market and see a real return on investment, before they go ahead and start a European operation.

We offer a range of sales, presales, marketing, operational and business development services – on a long-term contract or as a specific short-term assignment. We can:


* Help pitch the right products to the right customers at the right prices – letting vendors grab market share faster and more effectively than with a traditional approach


* Develop strategic alliances and build long-term relationships with value-added partners like resellers, distributors, systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)


* Recruit the right people to expand existing in-house capabilities


* Set local PR strategies and work with local PR agencies to increase overall visibility and press coverage


* Find funding and M&A opportunities
